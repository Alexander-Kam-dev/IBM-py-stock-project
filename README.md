This is the repo conatining my finished .ipynb file for the IBM Python project for data science.
In the notebook, I demonstrate my skills when it comes to webscraping, data visualization, and data extraction.
For this project I used python, as well as the yFinance, Pandas, Requests, Plotly, and BeautifulSoup libraries.
